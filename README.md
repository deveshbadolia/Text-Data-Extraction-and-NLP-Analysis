# Text-Data-Extraction-and-NLP-Analysis

The objective of the project was to extract textual data articles from given URLs and perform text analysis to compute various variables. The project involved data extraction, using Python programming, to extract the article text from the provided URLs and saving them in separate text files. Only the article title and text were extracted, excluding any irrelevant content.

For the extracted texts, a series of text analysis tasks were performed. The variables computed included positive score, negative score, polarity score, subjectivity score, average sentence length, percentage of complex words, FOG index, average number of words per sentence, complex word count, word count, syllable per word, personal pronouns, and average word length. These variables were calculated using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as cleaning the text by removing stop words and punctuation, creating dictionaries of positive and negative words, and applying formulas to derive the scores and metrics.

The output data structure, as provided in the "Output Data Structure.xlsx" file, was used to organize and save the computed variables for each article. The output file maintained the order of the input variables from the "Input.xlsx" file, followed by the calculated variables in the specified columns.

The project showcased the application of data extraction, NLP, and text analysis techniques in processing and analyzing textual data.
